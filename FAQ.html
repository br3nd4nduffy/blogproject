                        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

                        <h2>What is Tarot?</h2>

                        <p>Tarot is a system of divination rooted in cartomancy that uses a deck consisting of 22 Major Arcana and 56 Minor Arcana (Wands, Swords, Pentacles, and Cups.) Tarot traces its origins back to the 18th century. </p>

                        <h2>Can Tarot tell the future?</h2>

                        <p>That depends! While no one's future can be predicted, many people use Tarot as a means of guidance and reflection about major themes in their lives when they are looking to make a decision or consider the path ahead. Many people believe that it is a powerful tool in manifesting the energies and circumstances they'd like to see appear in their lives.</p>

                        <h2>Why use Tarot for journaling?</h2>

                        <p>Because Tarot is based on archetypes, and its illustrations are often which with colors and symbolism, it's a great tool for evoking strong feelings and reflecting on why they came up and what they may represent in our lives.</p>
